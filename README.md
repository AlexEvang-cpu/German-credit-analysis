# German-credit-analysis
 Description: This repository contains a Python project that focuses on predicting credit risk using a dataset of German credit data. The project involves performing hypothesis testing to identify significant predictors of credit risk and building a predictive model using data scaling techniques. The dataset is preprocessed and analyzed to create a new column "credit risk" which is numerically coded as 1 for good credit risks and 2 for bad credit risks. The project also includes visualizations, data exploration, and model evaluation to assess the accuracy and performance of the credit risk prediction model. The code is well-documented and organized, making it easy for others to understand and replicate the analysis. The repository serves as a resource for credit risk analysis and modeling purposes, and the project can be extended or customized for specific use cases.
