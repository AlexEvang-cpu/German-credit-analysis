*## German-credit-analysis
Description: This repository contains a Python project that focuses on predicting credit risk using a dataset of German credit data. The project involves performing hypothesis testing to identify significant predictors of credit risk and building a predictive model using data scaling techniques. The dataset is preprocessed and analyzed. The project also includes visualizations, data exploration, and model evaluation to assess the accuracy and performance of the credit risk prediction model. The code is well-documented and organized, making it easy for others to understand and replicate the analysis. The repository serves as a resource for credit risk analysis and modeling purposes, and the project can be extended or customized for specific use cases.
